WebDriver Test

Once you have cloned this repository, run composer update to get the latest libraries to run the script.  After composer has updated the repository, you'll be able to run the webdriver.php script.  If configured properly, a new chrome window will appear.  It will be directed to a website and automatically search for an item.
